=head1 NAME

Slay::Makefile::Gress - Use Slay::Makefile for software regression testing

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides support for running a set of regression tests
from a .t file by doing builds with a C<Slay::Makefile> file.

=head1 USAGE

To use this module, the .t file calling it should contain something like:

  use Slay::Makefile::Gress qw(do_tests);
  do_tests("SlayMakefile", @ARGV);

=head1 OVERVIEW

The basic functionality of this module is to take an initialization
subdirectory (by default ending ".init") and copy it over to a run
directory (by default ending ".dir"), doing a C<chdir> into the run
directory, and then parsing a C<Slay::Makefile> to define and run the
tests.  A reasonable way to accomplish this is to have the
C<Slay::Makefile> create a file with extension ".ok" that is empty if
the test passes; frequently this file can be the output of a diff
between the test's output and an expect file.  The C<Slay::Makefile>
can be in a parent directory so it can be shared by more than one
suite of tests (.t file).  A shared C<Slay::Makefile> can use the
include mechanism to bring in a local C<Slay::Makefile> files in the
run directory.  You can even use this methodology for developing
families of suites of tests, etc.

=head1 ROUTINES

=over

=item C<do_tests($makefile[, @tests] [, \%options ])>

Runs a series of tests using C<$makefile> as the C<Slay::Makefile>
input.  If C<@tests> are specified, it contains the list of tests,
each of which is a target that is built in order; otherwise the
dependencies of the C<test> target will be built as the list of tests.
The following options are recognized:

=over

=item init

The extension for the initialization directory.  Default is '.init'.

=item opts

A hash reference to be passed to Slay::Makefile::new as its options list.

=item pretest

The name of the target to be built prior to running tests to set
everything up.  Default is 'pretest'.

=item run

The extension for the run directory.  Default is '.run'.

=item skip

The name for perl scripts to run to check whether all tests should be
skipped.  The name is also used as an extension for a test's base name
to see if an individual tests should be skipped.

=item test

The name of the target whose dependencies gives the list of tests.
Default is 'test'.

=head1 PROCESSING

Processing proceeds by the following steps:

=over

=item 1.

Search for an initialization directory with the same base name as the
.t file invoking C<do_tests> and extension equal to the C<init>
option.  Croaks if there is no such directory.  For example, if the file
invoking c<do_tests> is C<cmdline.t> and the default initialization
extension is used, it looks for directory C<cmdline.init>.

=item 2.

Copy the initialization directory to a run directory and C<cd> into that
directory.

=item 3.

Check for a script with the name of the C<skip> option.  If it exists,
execute it.  If it returns a non-zero exit code, skip all the tests.
The text this script prints becomes the reason for skipping the tests.

=item 4.

Use C<Slay::Makefile> to parse the C<$makefile> file.  Note that the
working directory is the run directory when this file is processed.

=item 5.

Do a C<Slay::Makefile::make> of the C<pretest> target, if it exists.
The name of the C<pretest> target is 'pretest' unless specified in the
options.

=item 6.

If C<@tests> is empty, create a list of tests to execute by getting
the dependencies of the C<test> target.  The name of the C<test>
target is 'test' unless specified in the options.

=item 7.

For each test C<t>,

=over

=item a.

Check for a script with the same base name as C<t> and the extension
C<.> and the name of the C<skip> option..  For example, if the default
value of the C<skip> option is used, then a test C<algebra.ok> would
use a script called C<algebra.skip.pl>.  If the script exists, execute
it and skip the test if it returns a non-zero exit code.  The text
this script prints becomes the reason for skipping the test.

=item b.

Run C<Slay::Makefile::make> for target C<t>.

=item c.

If no file C<t> was generated, report a failed test as failing to
build the file.  If C<t> was generated, then it should be empty for a
passing test.  Any text in the file is returned as the reason for the
tests's failure.
